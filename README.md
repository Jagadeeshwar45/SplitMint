# 🌿 SplitMint — Expense Splitting, Simplified

> **SplitMint** is a full-stack expense splitting web application built for the Karbon Engineering Internship Challenge 2026. It lets groups of friends, roommates, or colleagues track shared expenses, compute who owes whom, and settle up — with an AI layer (MintSense) that understands natural language.

## ✨ Features

### 🔐 Authentication
- Email/password registration and login via **Supabase Auth**
- JWT-based session management
- Protected API routes with server-side token verification

### 👥 Groups
- Create groups with a name and up to **3 additional participants** (4 total including primary user)
- Edit group name inline
- Delete group with **cascade handling** (all expenses and splits removed)
- Color-coded participant avatars for visual identification

### 🧑 Participants
- Add participants to a group (up to the 4-person limit)
- **Edit participant name and color** inline — hover any member pill to reveal edit/delete controls
- Remove participants (with linked expense awareness)
- Color picker for personalized avatar colors

### 💸 Expenses
- Add expenses with: amount, description, date, payer, category
- **Three split modes:**
  - **Equal** — amount divided evenly, rounding handled on first participant
  - **Custom Amount** — specify exact rupee amount per person
  - **Percentage** — allocate by percentage (must total 100%)
- Edit and delete expenses
- Category tagging: Food, Travel, Entertainment, Utilities, Shopping, General
- Automatic balance recalculation on every change

### ⚖️ Balance Engine
- Computes net balance per participant across all expenses
- Shows directional amounts (who owes whom and how much)
- **Minimal settlement algorithm** — greedy debt reduction to minimize number of transactions
- Color-coded net balance chart (green = owed money, red = owes money)

### 📊 Visualizations
- Summary cards: Total Spent, Settlements Needed, Total Expenses
- **Recharts bar chart** of net balances per participant
- Detailed breakdown table with per-person owed/owing amounts
- Settlement suggestion cards with directional arrows

### 🔍 Search & Filters
- **Text search** across expense descriptions
- **Filter by payer** (dropdown)
- **Date range filter** — labeled "From" and "To" fields with mutual min/max constraints
- **Amount range filter** — min and max rupee values
- Active filter chips with individual clear buttons
- "Clear all" to reset filters instantly
- Filter count badge on the Filters toggle button

### 🤖 MintSense AI (Powered by Claude)
- Type expenses in plain English: *"Alice paid ₹800 for dinner, split equally among all"*
- AI parses and returns structured expense data (description, amount, payer, category, split mode)
- Preview parsed result before saving
- Example phrases provided for quick onboarding
- **AI Group Summary** — generates a friendly natural-language summary of group spending and settlements

## 🚀 Getting Started (Local Development)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project (free tier works)
- An [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com) (for MintSense)

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/splitmint.git
cd splitmint
```

### 2. Set up Supabase
Go to your Supabase project → SQL Editor → run the following:

```sql
CREATE TABLE groups (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE participants (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  group_id UUID REFERENCES groups(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  color TEXT DEFAULT '#6366f1',
  avatar TEXT,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE expenses (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  group_id UUID REFERENCES groups(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  amount NUMERIC(10,2) NOT NULL,
  paid_by UUID REFERENCES participants(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  split_mode TEXT CHECK (split_mode IN ('equal', 'custom', 'percentage')) DEFAULT 'equal',
  date DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,
  category TEXT DEFAULT 'general',
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE expense_splits (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  expense_id UUID REFERENCES expenses(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  participant_id UUID REFERENCES participants(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  amount NUMERIC(10,2) NOT NULL,
  percentage NUMERIC(5,2)
);

ALTER TABLE groups ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE participants ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE expenses ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE expense_splits ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Users manage own groups" ON groups FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = created_by);
CREATE POLICY "Group members see participants" ON participants FOR ALL USING (group_id IN (SELECT id FROM groups WHERE created_by = auth.uid()));
CREATE POLICY "Group members see expenses" ON expenses FOR ALL USING (group_id IN (SELECT id FROM groups WHERE created_by = auth.uid()));
CREATE POLICY "Group members see splits" ON expense_splits FOR ALL USING (expense_id IN (SELECT id FROM expenses WHERE group_id IN (SELECT id FROM groups WHERE created_by = auth.uid())));
```

### 3. Configure the server
```bash
cd server
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `server/.env`:
```env
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
PORT=4000
```

Install and run:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# API running on http://localhost:4000
```

### 4. Configure the client
```bash
cd client
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `client/.env`:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

Install and run:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# App running on http://localhost:5173
```

---

## ☁️ Deployment

### Frontend → Vercel

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Import repo on [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
3. Set **Root Directory** to `client`
4. Add environment variables:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
   VITE_API_URL=https://your-railway-api.railway.app
   ```
5. Deploy

### Backend → Railway

1. Create a new project on [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Connect your GitHub repo
3. Set **Root Directory** to `server`
4. Add environment variables from `server/.env`
5. Railway auto-detects Node.js and deploys

## 🧮 Balance Engine — How It Works

The balance engine builds a net balance matrix across all participants:

1. **Per expense:** for each split, the participant owes the payer their share amount
2. **Net balance:** `total owed to you` minus `total you owe others`
3. **Settlement algorithm:** Greedy two-pointer approach
   - Separate participants into debtors (negative balance) and creditors (positive balance)
   - Match debtors to creditors, settling the minimum of the two amounts
   - This produces the **fewest possible transactions** to settle all debts

### Rounding
For equal splits, the remainder from floating-point division is added to the first participant's share, ensuring the total always equals the expense amount exactly.

## 🤖 MintSense AI — How It Works

MintSense sends a structured prompt to Claude (claude-sonnet-4) with:
- The user's natural language statement
- The list of participant names in the group

Claude returns a JSON object with: `description`, `amount`, `paid_by_name`, `split_mode`, `participants`, `category`, and `date`.

The frontend maps participant names back to their database IDs, shows a preview, and lets the user confirm before saving.

## 🔒 Security

- All API routes are protected by JWT verification via Supabase
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies on all Supabase tables — users can only access their own data
- Service Role Key is **never** exposed to the frontend
- Environment variables separated between client (Vite) and server (Node)
